# Course Offer Module for the MIS

The Course Offering Project endeavours to optimise the procedure of providing courses such as DE, DC, DP, and OE across various programs and branches for each session/semester, adhering to their respective policies. It also facilitates the allocation of faculty members to these courses and assigns grading responsibilities to a faculty, by the Head of the Department of the respective department. Leveraging technologies such as Next.js for the frontend framework and Laravel for the backend, the project significantly streamlines the course offering process.

We have created the frontend on Next.js and backend on Laravel

#To run:

For backend:

- composer install
- add your own .env file from env-copy and add your db
